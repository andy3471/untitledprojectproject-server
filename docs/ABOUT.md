# About

I once was part of a video game modding team, making a mod for Portal 2. As part of that, I had a page on ModDB from the very begining, that I could use to share progress and ideas with like minded people. What was so fantastic about it, is that it became a place for other modders, who wanted to work on the project, to find it early and get in touch with me. I ended up forming a small team of people from all over the world that worked together on this little project.

I left the team very early on, and I claim no credit for anything that is in the mod now, however the team went on to complete it, and made a mod that won a Video Game Award, and is widely regarded as the closest thing we'll ever get to Portal 3, called Portal Stories: Mel, and it's completely free. It's very inspiring that these teams of strangers can form and create something that could even rival Valve at their own game.

What's very inspiring about this, is that even though the video game industry is heading more and more towards microtransactions and gambling mechanics, I know that we will always have good and solid well made games, because even if it's not for money, passionate groups of like minded people will still come together to make games and mods, for the fun of making them.

A couple of years ago, I was thinking, that I wish I had a site like ModDB for every project I made, a public page to keep me wanting to share what I'm working on. A place to meet people that saw value in the projects I was making and find people to work with. Me and a friend set out to make this, however like a lot of projects, it fizzled. But unlike most of my other projects that have fizzled out with time, I kept coming back to this idea.

I think it's incredibly important in times where we seem to keep getting more and more divided, that people get together and work together on things. Look at the Linux Foundation for example, and what positive impact that has, it powers a huge percentage of the web as we know it, imagine how much Microsoft would be charging for server licencing for every website out there, but instead, we'll always have a free alternative.

Usually, when I work on a web development project, I have it open for people to see the code and contribute, however I don't regularly go out and look for people to work with. However, this time, due to the nature of what I plan on creating, it feels like the perfect opportunity to seek out help from like-minded people, in order to make this happen. Don't worry if you don't have web development experience, there will always be something you can contribute too.

Maybe no-one will want to join, and it'll be just me again, that's fine too, but I wanted to create this page as an open offer to people to try and get them interested.

## The Plan

I plan to always keep the app and the code completely open source. However, at some point in the future, when the Minimum Viable Product is built, I aim to host it on servless architecture, to try and grow it as a site. I will invite anyone that has contributed on the project to be a part of that, proportional to the time investment that they have put it. That site may add monetised features in the future, in order to cover hosting costs, if we do by some miracle do grow it.

However, you may take the code and host your own rival site under a different name, there's nothing stopping that. I just want to give this site the best chance of existing.

It's important to remember that this site, like a lot of others, has odds stacked against it. It is incredibly importnat to remember that if you decide to contribute, you may put a huge amount of time in this, to get 5 users. I need people that enjoy developing and working on it, and for that to be it's own reward, or people that want to better themselves by learning new skills.

We are currently planning out the MVP version of the site, but it'll likely include Social Media like profiles, Project Pages, Internal pages for projects to communicate, Instant Messaging, Team Pages (groups that can also work on projects) and more.

The site will not just be for tech and programming projects, but for all kinds. I'd love to make this a place where bands can find new members, film makers can find actors. Your page can then act as a portfolio for things you work on in your time, and act as something you can show other members, or even employers.

As someone who strongly dislikes social media, I want to create a social media site that is privacy heavy, making sharing your real name optional, that never mines user data or presents ads.

## The Tech

Currently, I plan to build UPP on Laravel. The reason I'd like to use laravel, is that it's quite opinionated in the way you should do things, name classes for example. That way, if people learn the Laravel Best Practices, it should be very easy to keep the project organised.

I currently plan to use VueJS, as it has a minimal learning curve and it easy to learn, but I may switch to react, depending on the scope of the app.

We currently do not have any plans for a mobile app, but it may be something we look at once the MVP is built.

These are not set though, if we end up with people on the team that want to work with different technologies, then I am completely open to it.

## Contributing

If you are like minded, and would like to contribute, then please get in touch. If you have web development skills, or skills with PHP and Laravel, even better.

If you do not have interest in web development, but like the idea of this, then you can still be a lot of help, please don't be afraid to get in touch.

If you would like to get into web development, but do not have the skills currently, that's okay. I want passionate people that will put time into it. You can use this application as an excuse to learn web development, and hardly contribute anything to the main site, I'll still want you to be a part of the site, as I know you're passionate about the idea.

I'm open to anyone being a part of this, and people can contribute as little or as much as they want to.

Please get in touch with me via email on me@andyh.app if you would like to be involved.
